# City Building Game

## Overview
I'm [@Fulbion](https://github.com/Fulbion/), and sometimes I feel stressed, mainly because of my daily routine. So in order to calm myself down a bit, I play some relaxing games. And I had an idea: why not making a really chill game, where you can build your own town? And maybe share your town to other people. So I started the development in April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2023.

## Project
You can have access to the full advancement of the project by getting to the [project page](https://github.com/users/Fulbion/projects/2). Unfortunately, it is written in French, because I also record a devlog where I show the project progress.

By the way, here is a small recap of the advancement:

- [x] Setting up the project
- [ ] Making the UI library (panels, buttons, etc.)
- [x] Making the game state and the main menu state
- [ ] Making the map editor
- [ ] Linking the game with a database

As you can see, I'm at the very beginning of the project. I'm done with the game state, so I'm working on making my own UI library.

# Installation
There is no way you can test the game for now. :P  
The game is not finished yet, so I want to release the project once it is at a good advancement point. No need to be perfect, but at least, it has to be working.
